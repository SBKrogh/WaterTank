\section{Implementation}

For the modifications suggested in \secref{sec:improvement} to be effective, they need to be implemented on both the computer running ROS and the sbRIO board. As the two systems are programed in very different ways, i.e. the computer can be programed through traditional means, in our case through C++ and the sbRIO has to be programed through Labview.
