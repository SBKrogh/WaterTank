\section{Pressure Control}
\label{pressure_control}

As described in \secref{control_problem} the two PMA pumps should generate a constant differential pressure. Furthermore \secref{control_problem} conclude that a simple PI controller, reaction to a reference calculated by the MPC, should be used to control the pressure generated by the main pumps. 

For convenience the simple controller, that should be used for the PMA pumps, is also chosen as a PI controller. The two set of pumps are very similar, only deviating in a few parameters. Therefor only one of the controller will be explained in this section.
