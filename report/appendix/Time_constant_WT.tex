\section{Water tower time constant}
\label{sec:WT_TimeConstant}

In this section the time constant of the water tank is found.
\todo{Found or tested i compare with theory?}

%\subsection{One clamp push} % \label{app:...}
\subsection*{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The water distribution system at AAU.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure:}
The following procedure was made for finding the time constant:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wait for the system to get into a steady state position with the following system setup: valve opening at 0.7 for all consumer valves and differential pressure over pumps at C2 = C16 = 0.2, C18 = 0.1, C25 = 0.25.
\item Increase the differential pressure over C2 with 0.1.
\item Wait 1.5 hour.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Measuring data:}
The data from the measurements can be seen on 

\begin{figure}
\input{report/tikz/Time_constant_Water_Tank}
\caption{The data measurement for the finding the time constant of the WT. A small red dot shows the time constant for the tank which is 984 seconds.}
\label{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Uncertainties of measurement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The settling time for the initial state was not reached after 1.5 hours.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion:}
As it can be seen on \figref{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant}, the time constant of the water tower is 984 seconds. From this the settling time for the WT can be found as $984\cdot 5 = 4920$ seconds.
