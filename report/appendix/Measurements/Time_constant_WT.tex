\section{Water tower time constant}
\label{sec:WT_TimeConstant}

\subsection*{Purpose:}
The purpose of this test is to determine the time constant and settling time of WT.


%\subsection{One clamp push} % \label{app:...}
\subsection*{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The water distribution system at AAU.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure:}
The following procedure was made for finding the time constant:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wait for the system to get into a steady state position with the following system setup: valve opening at $0.7 \%$ for all consumer valves and differential pressure over pumps at $C2 = C16 = 0.2 Bar$, $C18 = 0.1 Bar$, $C25 = 0.25 Bar$.
\item Increase the differential pressure over C2 with 0.1 Bar.
\item Wait 1.5 hour.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Measuring data:}
The measurements data can be found on the attached storage under the path: \path{CD:/Data/WT timeconstant}, a plot of the data is shown in \figref{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant}.

\subsection*{Results:}

The time constant of the WT can be found through the linear differential equation shown in \eqref{statespace_4}. By Laplace transform and solving for the input output relation, the standard form of the transfer function for the WT can be derived as see in \eqref{eq:std_trans_tank_time}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	&\Delta \dot{p}_{WT} = A_p \Delta \hat{p}_{WT}  + \pmb{B_p}\pmb{\hat{u}}\\
	&s\Delta p_{WT}(s) = A_p \Delta \hat{p}_{WT}(s)  + \pmb{B_p}\pmb{\hat{u}(s)}\\
	&\frac{\Delta p_{WT}(s)}{u(s)} = \frac{B}{s-A} = \frac{\frac{B}{A}}{\frac{1}{A}s + 1}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:std_trans_tank_time}
\end{equation}

From the denominator, the time constant of the WT can be directly read as seen in \eqref{eq:direct_time_constant}

\begin{equation}
	\tau s + 1
	\label{eq:direct_time_constant}
\end{equation}

 Since A in \eqref{statespace_4} is a constant, due to the tank only having one state, the WT has one time constant. However the unit of A is in $[\frac{m^3}{h}]$ and needs to be convert to seconds. \todo{Convert from $$m3^3/h$$ and see how much it fits compared to the test below}

As the dynamics of the WT are described by a first order system, the time constant can be found as the time the system uses to reach $63.2\%$ of the steadystate pressure.
This pressure at $63.2\%$ of the steadystate values is based on the minimum and maximum pressure values during the step and determined to:

\begin{equation}
(0.137 - 0.127)*63.2 \% = 0.0063 \rightarrow 0.127 + 0.0063 = 0.133 Bar 
\end{equation}

Based on the data is it found that at a pressure of 0.133 bar the time is passed is 1155 seconds corresponding to 19,25 minutes. 

On \figref{fig:Test_WT_Timeconstant} the measurement data used to determine the time constant of the WT is shown. A small red dot indicates the time constant for the tank.

\end{figure}

Based on the determined time constant and the first order model, the settling time of the tank can be found as $1155\cdot 5 = 5775$ seconds equal to 1.6 hours.

\subsection*{Uncertainties of measurement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The settling time for the initial state was not reached after 1.5 hours.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion:}
From this test both the time constant and the settling time of the WT are determined. The results are based on the fact that the WT dynamics can be described by a first order system, thereby is the time constant found by applying a step to the system and determined to be 19,25 minutes. Furthermore is the settling determined to be 1.6 hours. It can thus be concluded that the purpose of this test is fulfilled and the dynamics of the WT are found.
