\section{Small signal pump measurements}
\label{sec:small_sig_pump}

In this section the small signal deviation of the linearized pump model is measured.


%\subsection{One clamp push} % \label{app:...}
\subsection*{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The water distribution system at AAU.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure:}
The following procedure was made for finding the small signal deviations of the pumps
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wait for the system to reach the operating point.
\item Add $0.1\omega$ to the rotational speed for one of the pumps and wait for steady state.
\item Note differential pressure over the pump, subtract the added speed for the pump and wait for operating steady state. 
\end{enumerate}
Point 2-3 is done for each pump where the pressure over the pump is noted 

\subsection*{Measuring data:}
The data from the measurements can be seen on

\subsection*{Uncertainties of measurement:}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The settling time for the initial state was not reached after 1.5 hours.
