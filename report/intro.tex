\chapter{Introduction}

Water pressure management is a vital part of the infrastructure all over the world. It ensures that a positive water pressure is present such that the consumers are supplied with water at all time. Maintaining a minimum pressure in the water network is an important task as the risk of water contamination is minimized\cite{national2005public}. Simply said, if the pressure is not sufficient it can become a health issue for the consumers. 

%Therefore if the pressure is not sufficient it can become a health issue for the consumers. The pressure must be high enough to ensure that the end consumers have a certain amount of

\item Water pressure. 

Health, consumer satisfaction
\item Why is it necessary to increase the efficiency in PMAs?

Large amount of energy used to prepare water and to distributing it to the users.

\item Decrease of water quality when stored. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The oxygen ($O_2$) level at the consumer should be no lower than 5 $mg/L$. 
\item Depending factors for water lifespan in a tank. (Quality of the water, open/closed tank, chemical treatments, room light and temperature )  % Source in Spanish https://www.soloarquitectura.com/foros/threads/cuanto-tiempo-puede-estar-el-agua-en-un-deposito-sin-pudrirse.53557/
