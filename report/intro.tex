\chapter{Introduction}

Water pressure management is a vital part of the infrastructure all over the world. It ensures that a positive water pressure is present such that the consumers all ways are supplied with water. Maintaining a certain pressure in the water network is an important task as the risk of water contamination is minimized\cite{national2005public} and that the end consumer can get water 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Water pressure. 

Health, consumer satisfaction
\item Why is it necessary to increase the efficiency in PMAs?

Large amount of energy used to prepare water and to distributing it to the users.

\item Decrease of water quality when stored. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The oxygen ($O_2$) level at the consumer should be no lower than 5 $mg/L$. 
\item Depending factors for water lifespan in a tank. (Quality of the water, open/closed tank, chemical treatments, room light and temperature )  % Source in Spanish https://www.soloarquitectura.com/foros/threads/cuanto-tiempo-puede-estar-el-agua-en-un-deposito-sin-pudrirse.53557/
