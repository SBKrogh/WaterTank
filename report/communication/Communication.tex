\chapter{Communication}\label{cha:communication}

As stated in the introduction, the force feedback loop should at least have a frequency of 550 Hz. This loop not only includes the communication between the Geomagic Touch and the computer but also the communication between the sbRIO and the computer and the computation time required for force estimation. In the current setup, the bottleneck is the communicating between the sbRIO and the computer as it can not exceed 100 Hz. As the drivers handling the communication with the Geomagic Touch have a refresh rate of 1000 Hz and the computation time should be small compared to the refresh rate, the frequency of the communication with the embedded system should be at least 1200 Hz. However, from experimentation it was found out that the built-in library for UDP on the sbRIO cannot handle a frequency higher than 1000 Hz. If this maximum frequency is reached, the feedback loop will have a refresh rate of 500 Hz, see \figref{fig:speed_graph}, which is still deemed acceptable according to \cite{coles2011role}.  This chapter focuses on improving this communication to reach 1000 Hz.

\section{Measurements}

In order to evaluate the performance of the new communication protocol, measurements of jitter and packet loss were made for different frequencies. To quantify the improvements an attempt was made to measure the performances of the previous communication. However, as the communication does not have the expected behaviour when increasing the refresh rate, the results could not be used, details are available in \secref{sec_tcp_mes}. The only comparison between the two protocols that can be made with available data is between the maximum refresh rate that can be reached.

The data resulting from the measurements of the designed communication protocol are gathered in \tabref{tab:new_protocol}.

From a frequency of 99 Hz to 474 Hz, it can be seen that the jitter, as well as the packet loss increase. As both of them are mainly consequences of congestion on the network\cite{cisco_jitter}, this phenomenon was expected. However, when the frequency is increased to 638 Hz, the jitter decreases and the packet loss keeps increasing. The cause is that the jitter increases but the driver only waits 1 ms to receive a packet from the sbRIO after sending and thus rejects the packets coming after that deadline. The packet loss could be reduced by increasing the waiting time but that would reduce the frequency. A trade-off between frequency and error rate has to be made.
The data for the maximum frequency of the driver could not be collected as the congestion on the network becomes too significant. When that happens, the communication does not behave as intended and each device sends more than one packet in a row.

The communication cannot reach frequencies higher than 638 Hz due to congestion, thus not meeting the requirements. However by implementing the new communication protocol the refresh was increased from 100 Hz to 638 Hz. Solutions to further improve the refresh rate are discussed in \chapref{cha:discussion}.
