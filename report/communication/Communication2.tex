% The goal of the project is to provide a teleoperated surgical system which makes the surgeon controlling the robot feel as if he was manipulating the end-effector directly. To achieve this, the time delay of the force between the end-effector and the controller should be unnoticeable. The targeted communication frequency of 1 kHz should result in a delay small enough to satisfy this need.
% \todo{What is the relation between sample rate and delay? and we need a REF!}
% % Relation between sampel rate and delay is \frac{sampel_time}{\frac{1}{f}}
