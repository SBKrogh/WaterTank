\subsection{sbRIO}

The embedded system controlling the EndoWrist contains a \textbf{Single Board Reconfigurable Input/Output 9636} (sbRIO) controller, see \figref{fig:sbRIO9636}. It is responsible for interfacing between the surgical robot and the computer running the robotic operating system\cite{Chris_Surgical}, see \secref{sec:ros}. It reads the data sent by the ESCON drivers, sends them to the PC and position controls the motors based on the received reference signals. The sbRIO has built in safety protocols that disable the motors in case of error.

The controller consists of
\begin{itemize}
	\item 400 MHz real time processor
	\item 256 MB of system memory and 512 MB nonvolatile memory
	\item Reconfigurable Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA
	\item 16 bit analog and digital I/O
	\item Built in USB, CAN, 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet peripherials
\end{itemize}

The board is configured through an ethernet cable. The programs can be written using Labview, C or C++. In the present project, LabView will be used due to the simplicity of coding the FPGA through a high level language. The board is capable of running in real-time. %code, which is unmatched on the ROS side.

%The ESCON motor controllers are attached to the sbRIO controller and send the control signals through cables. The motor has a nominal torque of 6.96 mNm.
%4 Maxon motors are used for the actuation of the endowrist. The motors are implemented using a combination gear (Maxon 353816) including the gearing, the servo motor and the sensors. The ESCON motor controllers are attached to the sbRIO controller and send the control signals through cables. The motor has a nominal torque of 6.96 mNm.
