\chapter*{Preface}

This report covers the 8th semester project at control and automation at Aalborg university for the Department of Electronic systems. The project is produced by group 17gr830.\\
The goal of this project was to control and optimize the running cost of a water distribution system, which had been extended with a water tower.  

The report is constructed with a small introduction to the system, how it was modeled and parameters was estimated, the derivative of the controller and a simulation of the model and the controller. A discussion tells what improvements could be done and leads up to the final conclusion. The reader can find a nomenclature at the beginning of the report which include acronyms, a symbolic list and a notation list. In the appendix detailed derivations can be found, an assumption list and the measurements used for this project.
