This project covers the modelling and predictive control of a water distribution network with the aim of minimizing energy and economic cost. The system consists of four pumps and a water tower.\\
At first a non-linear model of the components and the dynamics of the system are modelled based on a graph-based approach which leads to a state space representation of the whole network.\\ 
System identification is carried out on the non-linear model due to the uncertain parameters of the pipe components, which showed bad results. The non-linear model is linearized and a new parameter estimations is done, which shows better results.\\
A model predictive controller is designed to minimize the running cost of the linearized model while maintaining pressure, upper and lower bound constraints for the system.\\
Furthermore, four PI controllers are designed to controller the pumps in the system. Two of which are to make a constant pressure lift where the last two are to follow the reference set by the model predictive controller. \\
Simulations of the controller shows, when energy prices increases the pressure reference are also increased, which is not expected.\\
At the end a discussion and conclusion is made, with suggestion on what should be edited to get the implementation of the controller to work.
