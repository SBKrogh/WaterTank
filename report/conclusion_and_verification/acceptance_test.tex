\label{accepttest}

In this section the controller designed in \chapref{control_design} will be tested on the available test setup in order to verify if the requirements described in \chapref{Requirements_and_constraints} are meet. 

The designed MPC is implemented as a receding horizon control with a 24 hour control horizon due to the behavior of the electrical price and the water consumption which both have a periodicity of 24 hours. 
Based on this, a test conducted over a 24 hour period would allow to investigate the main characteristics of the MPC when price and consumption deviations during a day occur due to the periodicity of the data.   
Due to time limitations the test is scaled down to minimize the time used to conduct the measurements. 
The scaling factor has been chosen with the dynamics of the WT in mind. 
The time constant of the WT is determined to approximately 20 minutes, thus the scaling has been chosen in such a way that a one hour period for the MPC will last 10 minutes which is equal to half of the WT time constant. 
Thereby will the dynamics of the WT still be present and affect the system significantly within each optimization step.
