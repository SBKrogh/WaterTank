In this project the main focus has been on deriving, estimating and controlling the water distribution system with an attached water tower at Aalborg university. Multiple models that describe the pressure loss over different components in the system has been used to gather a fully expression that describe the pressure loss over a specific part in the system. To represent the fully system, graph based theory has been used to describe the flow and pressure. 

The system has been linearized through a first order Taylor expansion and unknown parameters has then been estimated through the \textit{Linear Grey-Box Models} tool in Matlab. A verification of the estimates has been made, where the behavior of the models has followed the expectation. 

A model predictive controller has been derived, with varieties of constraints i.e. on the input and output. Without constraints simulations shows expected behavior. With constraints a feasible solution is not possible.
