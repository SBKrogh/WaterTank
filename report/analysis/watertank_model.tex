\subsection{Water Tower} 
\label{WaterTankModel}

Water towers are commonly used to maintain the correct pressure level in the system, ensure the reliability of the system 
and to improve the water supply in emergency cases. The water tower is a fundamental part of the system when controlling the pressure, therefore it is 
necessary to obtain its dynamic model. 

In the same way as done in the modelling of the pipes, valves and pumps, the pressure difference needs to be found. 
To do so, BernoulliÂ´s principle is applied between two points (see figure...).

\begin{equation}
  \label{bernoulli}
  h_1\rho g + p_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho {v_1}^2 = h_2\rho g + p_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho {v_2}^2
\end{equation}

%The pressure at point $1$ ($p_1$) is considered to be equal to the atmospherical pressure 
%so it is set to be $0$. 
The bottom of the tank is taken as the reference point. The height at point $2$ ($h_2$) matches with the reference level 
where the height is equal to 0. The flow speeds are equal in both $1$ 
and $2$, so they omit between each other. \refeq{bernoulli} results in: 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta p = h \rho g
  \label{Pressuredifference}
\end{equation}

In \refeq{Pressuredifference} the gravity and the density will remain constant, 
however the height will change depending on time. 
To derive the equation that describes the behavior of the height according to 
time the law of conservation mass is applied. This law can be specifically used for the flow in the water tower, describing the difference between the inlet and outlet flow 
to be equal to the velocity by which the tank volume increases or decreases. 

\begin{equation}
  q_{out} - q_{in} = \frac{dV_t}{dt} = \frac{dAh}{dt} = A \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 {dh}
  \label{FlowConservation}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $q_i$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $V_t$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $D$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}

is the volume of the water tower\\

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m^3}$

\end{minipage}

Rewriting \refeq{FlowConservation} in a simplified way:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta q =  \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 {dh}
\end{equation}

In order to solve for $h$ both sides are integrated: 
\begin{equation}
  \int dh = \int \frac{1}{A} \Delta q dt
  \label{integheight}
\end{equation}

Simplifying \refeq{integheight}:
\begin{equation}
  h =\frac{1}{A}  \int  \Delta q dt
\end{equation}

Once the equation describing $h$ is obtained, it can be inserted in \refeq{Pressuredifference} 
resulting in the final expression for the water tower model:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta p =  \frac{\rho g}{A}  \int  \Delta q dt
\end{equation}
