% This section should contain to things. 

% 1: Req. for water pressure 
% 2: Constrain about water quality 

Adding a WT to an existing water distribution network will introduce constrains and these have to be taken into account. 

As mentioned in \secref{introduction} a minimum pressure must be maintained at the end user. Furthermore the pressure can't exceed a maximum level as this will increase water leakage and increase wear on the pipes in the system. The system described in \secref{system_overview} is designed to operate at a pressure around 0.1 bar, relative to the environment \cite{master_aau}. For the purpose of this project the interval for which the pressure should be within, at the end user, is chosen to $0.08 < p < 0.14$ [Bar].

Another important aspect is water quality. If the
