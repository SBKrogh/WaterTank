% This section should contain to things. 

% 1: Req. for water pressure 
% 2: Constrain about water quality 

Adding a WT to an existing water distribution network will introduce constrains and these have to be taken into account. 

As mentioned in \secref{introduction} a minimum pressure must be maintained at the end user. Furthermore the pressure can't exceed a maximum level as this will increase water leakage and increase wear on the pipes in the system. The system described in \secref{system_overview} is designed to operate at a pressure around 0.1 bar, relative to the environment \cite{master_aau}. For the purpose of this project the interval for which the pressure should be within, at the end user, is chosen to $0.08 < p < 0.14$ [Bar].

Another important aspect is water quality. If the water is stored, in the WT, for to long the quality will decrease due to decreasing oxygen level. Because of this a requirement for water quality have to be formulated. As described in \secref{system_overview} the WT have one combined input/output connection. Therefor a requirement for flow is hard to formulate. Instead a requirement for how often the contents of the WT should be exchanged per time unit. For the purpose of this project the minimum requirement is chosen too $30\% $



Because of this a minimum
