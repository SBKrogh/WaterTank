\subsection{Pump Model} 
\label{PumpModel}
In order to move water from the reservoirs to the costumers, pumping is required. To guarantee that the water reaches every end-user with the appropriate pressure, different pumps can be used in the water distribution system.\\
Centrifugal pumps are ideal for this purpose. 
%They generate pressure within they guarantee a constant flow of water at a constant pressure for any given set of conditions. 
A model describing the pressure drop is derived which is presented in detail in \cite{Phd_Carsten}. The pressure provided by the pump is given by:
\todo{The list bellow should be with units.}
\begin{equation}
  \Delta p = -a_{h2}{q_i}^2 + a_{h1} \omega_r q_i + a_{h0}{\omega_r}^2

\subsubsection*{Pump Power Consumption}
In \secref{introduction} it has been introduced the aim of the project, consisting on minimizing the power consumption of the pumps in order to reduce 
the cost of running the hydraulic setup. Therefore, a model of the pump power consumption is needed so it can be used afterwards. In \cite{Phd_Carsten} 
an expression for the torque produced in a centrifugal pump is derived. 

\begin{equation}
  \tau = -a_{t2}{q_i}^2 + a_{t1} {\omega}_r {q_i} + a_{t0} {{\omega}_r}^2
  \label{pumptorque}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $a_{t2}$, $a_{t1}$, $a_{t0}$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $q_i$ \\
and \hspace*{0.7mm} $\omega_r$ 

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}

is the volume flow through the impeller,\\

\end{minipage}	

Making use of the relation between torque and electrical power, $P_e = \tau \omega$, the above expression can be rewritten in terms of electrical 
power. 

\begin{equation}
  P_e = -a_{t2}{q_i}^2{\omega}_r + a_{t1} {{\omega}_r}^2 {q_i} + a_{t0} {{\omega}_r}^3
  \label{pumptorque}
\end{equation}
