\section{Hydraulic Model}
\label{HydraulicModel}

Water distribution networks are designed to deliver water to consumers in terms of sufficient pressure and appropriate chemical composition. Distribution systems as such are generally consist of four main components: pipes, pumps, valves and reservoirs. The common property of these is that they are all two-terminal components, therefore they can be characterized by the dynamic relationship between the pressure drop accross the two endpoints and the flow through the element. \cite{Kallesoe2009}  \eqref{ComponentState} shows the state vector of one component. 

\begin{equation}
\label{ComponentState}
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \Delta P \\
    q
\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
    P_{in} - P_{out} \\
    q
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
In the following chapter the hydraulic model analysis of the system is done by control volume approach. \cite{Hunt_Fluidmechanics} 
The two state parameters are introduced for each component in the hydraulic network.


\subsection{Pipe Model} 
\label{PipeModel}
Pipes are major components of water distribution systems since they are used for carrying pressurized and treated fresh water. A detailed model of pipes has to be derived in a general form in order to describe the relationship of pressure and flow for each pipe component.  
%
The dynamic model of a pipe can be originated from Newton's second law. \eqref{NewtonLaw} describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the momentum of the fluid(water) and the force acting on it.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} P = \sum F
  \label{NewtonLaw}
\end{equation} 

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $F$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $P$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the force acting on the water,\\
is the linear momentum of the water flow.

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{N}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{kgm}{s}}$
\end{minipage}

The dynamics of a pipe component is derived under the assumption that the flow of the fluid is uniformly distributed along the cross sectional area of the pipe and the flow is turbulent. In other words, all pipes in the system are filled up fully with water all the time and the water is assumed to be incompressible. Thus the density of water and the volume of the fluid is constant in time, as the mass of the water is.
\\
Rewriting \eqref{NewtonLaw}, for the above-mentioned consideration the mass of the water can be taken out in front of the derivative.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} P = {\frac{d(M v)}{dt}} = M \frac{dv}{dt} = \sum F
\end{equation} 

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $M$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $v$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the mass of the water,\\
is the absolute value of the velocity of the water at each point of the pipe.

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{kg}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m}{s}}$
\end{minipage}

The sum of the forces acting on the control volume can be seen as input forces(acting on the inlet of the pipe), output forces(acting on the outlet) and resistance forces.  
These forces are expressed in terms of pressure in order to obtain the model of the pressure drop in the pipes. 

The diameter of the pipe is assumed to be constant and to have cylindrical structure:
\begin{equation}
  A_{in} = A_{out} = \frac{1}{4}\pi D^{2}
\end{equation}

Continuity law in fluid mechanics is applied to analyse the flow in the pipe. \cite{Hunt_Fluidmechanics} A steady and uniform mass flow is assumed in the pipe. Hence, the water flow can be described as: 
\todo{From here, Q is used for q, inconsequently}
\begin{equation}
  Q=A \cdot V
	\label{EquationOfContinuity}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $A$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $Q$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the cross sectional area of a pipe\\
is the volumetric rate of flow

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m^{2}}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m^{3}}{s}}$
\end{minipage}

 In \eqref{LinearMomentum} the forces acting on the pipe are included, the difference between $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$ represents the pressure drop 
 between two endpoints.

\begin{equation}
  M \frac{dv}{dt} = F_{in} - F_{out} - F_{res} \\
  \label{LinearMomentum}
\end{equation}

In order to obtain an equation consisting of only pressure parameters, the relationship between forces and pressures is used.


 \begin{equation}
    A L \rho \frac{dv}{dt} = A \textit{p}_{in} - A \textit{p}_{out} - F_{res} \\
\end{equation}

The velocity can be written in terms of volumetric water flow and cross sectional area according to the continuity law.

\begin{equation}
    A L \rho \frac{d}{dt} \frac{q}{A} = A \textit{p}_{in} - A \textit{p}_{out} - F_{res} \\
\end{equation}

Reducing the cross sectional area to obtain an expression for the pressure: 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =p_{in} - p_{out} - \frac{ F_{res}}{A} \\
\end{equation}

Thus the desired pressure drop between two endpoint is obtained. \eqref{PressureDrop} differential equation describes the change in flow as a function of the pressure drops in the system.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - \frac{ F_{res}}{A} \\
    \label{PressureDrop}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $L$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $F_{res}$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\Delta p$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\rho$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}

is the length of a pipe\\
is the resistance force\\
is the pressure drop across the two endpoints\\
is the density of water.

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{kg}{m^{3}}}$
\end{minipage}

In \eqref{PressureDrop} the term $F_{res}$ is the resistance force acting on the 
pipe, which consists of two parts: surface resistance($h_{f}$), the friction 
loss, form resistance($h_{m}$) and the resistance due to change of elevation, $\Delta z$. 

\subsubsection{Surface Resistance ($h_f$)} 
The flow of a liquid through a pipe suffers a resistance force resulting from 
the turbulences occurring along the internal walls of the pipe, created by the surface roughness of the pipe material. This surface 
resistance is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation \cite{Design_Water}.\todo{cite reference}

\begin{equation}
  h_f = \frac{fLV^2}{2gD}
  \label{Darcy}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $f$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $g$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $D$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the Moody friction factor\\ 
is acceleration due to gravity\\
is the diameter of the pipe.

\end{minipage}
\todo{cite reference1}

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{-}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m}{s^2}}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m}$
\end{minipage}

Applying the continuity law, the velocity can be substituted by the volumetric flow and pipe area, resulting in:

\begin{equation}
  h_f = \frac{8fLQ^2}{\pi^{2}gD^5}
  \label{DarcyWeisbach}
\end{equation} 
 
 The unknown parameter in \refeq{DarcyWeisbach} is the Moody friction factor 
 which is non-dimensional and is a function of the Reynold´s number. This friction factor depends on the flow if it is laminar, transient or turbulent, and the roughness of the tube. \\
 
 
The Reynold´s number can be used to determine if the regime of the flow. When $Re<2300$ as laminar, if $2300<Re<4000$ as transient and if
$Re>4000$ as turbulent \cite{Intro_Fluid}. 
\begin{equation}
   Re = \frac{vD}{\nu}
   \label{Reynolds}
 \end{equation}
 
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\nu$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the kinematic viscosity

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{kg}{ms}}$
\end{minipage}

The kinematic viscosity in \cite{Design_Water} is given by :
\begin{equation}
  \nu = 1.792 \cdot 10^{-6} \bigg[1+{\bigg(\frac{T}{25}\bigg)}^{1.165} \bigg]^{-1}
\end{equation}

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $T$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the water temperature  
 \end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{^{\circ} C}$
\end{minipage}

In order to estimate the range of the Reynolds number that a common water 
distribution has, typical values of the temperature, velocity and the radius of 
the pipes are considered \cite{Urban_Design}. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item $v = 0.5 - 1.5  \quad \frac{m}{s}$
  \item $D = 50 - 1500\quad mm$
  \item $T = 10 - 20 \quad ^{\circ} C$
\end{itemize}

This values result in a Reynolds number between 19000 and 225000, which yields the fluid to be turbulent. For turbulent flow the 
Moody friction factor is given by \cite{Design_Water} : 

\begin{equation}
  f = 1.325 \bigg(ln\bigg(\frac{\epsilon}{3.7 D}+\frac{5.74}{R^{0.9}}\bigg)\bigg)^{-2}
  \label{turbulent}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\epsilon$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the average roughness of the wall inside the pipe.
 \end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{-}$
\end{minipage}

%
\subsubsection{Form Resistance ($h_m$)} 
The form resistance losses appear any time the flow changes direction, such an elbow and bends,
or due to enlargers and reducers. It is a particular frictional resistance due to the 
fittings of a pipe. Form loss can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  h_m = k_f \frac{V^2}{2g}
\end{equation}


Applying the continuity law:

\begin{equation}
   h_m = k_f \frac{8Q^2}{\pi^2gD^4}
\label{Formloss}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $k_f$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the form-loss coefficient.  
 \end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{-}$
\end{minipage}

The form-loss coefficient can be split into different loss depending on the 
fitting of the pipes: pipe bend and elbows. 
\\
Pipe bends principally is determined by the 
bend angle $\alpha$ and bend radius $R$, it is given by the following 
expression \cite{Design_Water}: 

\begin{equation}
  k_f = \bigg[0.0733 + 0.923 \bigg(\frac{D}{R}\bigg)^{3.5}\bigg]\alpha^{0.5}
\end{equation}

Pipe elbows are also used to change the direction of the flow but providing 
sharp turns in pipelines. The coefficient for the losses in elbows is determined by the elbows angle $\alpha$ and it is given by:

\begin{equation}
  k_f = 0.442\alpha^{2.17}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Complete Pipe Model}
In \eqref{DarcyWeisbach} and \eqref{Formloss}, the head loss of the friction losses are determined. These terms are introduced in \eqref{PressureDrop} in terms of pressure. Thus, the friction factors are multiplied by the water density and gravity. Nevertheless, the head loss due to elevation has to be added in the model, yielding the final expression:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - h_f \rho g - h_m \rho g - \Delta z \rho 
   g
\end{equation}
\todo{zpp has to be corrected in these equations}

Substituting the terms $h_f$ and $h_m$ with their respective values:
\begin{equation}
   \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - \frac{8fLQ^2}{\pi^{2}gD^5} \rho g - k_f \frac{8Q^2}{\pi^2gD^4} \rho g - \Delta z \rho g 
\end{equation}

Taking out the flow $q$ as the common factor:
\begin{equation}
\label{FinalPipeModel}
   \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - \frac{8fLQ^2}{\pi^{2}gD^5} \rho g - k_f \frac{8Q^2}{\pi^2gD^4} \rho g - \Delta z \rho g 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Valve Model}  
\label{ValveModel}

Valves in the water distribution system are modelled according to the same principle as pipes with the difference that the length of each valve($L$) and the change in elevation($\Delta z$) are assumed to be zero. Therefore it is assumed that the length of the valve does not influence the flow and the pressure between the endpoints considering the fact that the length of a valve is considerably smaller than the length of a pipe. Another fair assumption is that in case of a valve, elevation is not present. \\
In the given system, valves are considered as end-user components since they are placed only in the PMAs. These user valves have a variable opening degree(OD) which influences the pressure drop across the endpoints. Valves can be also seen as pipe fittings where the OD is constant for all times, however there are not any fittings in the system, moreover the model of pipes covers it anyway. \\
Recalling \eqref{FinalPipeModel}, it simplifies as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\label{ValveModel}
 \Delta p =  - k_f \frac{8q^2}{\pi^2gD^4} \rho g 
\end{equation}

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
\subsection{Pump Model} 
\label{PumpModel}







 
 \textbf{Kirchhoff´s Law implementation for hydraulic networks}\\
 \label{KirchhoffLaw}
 Kirchhoff´s law represents the interconnection of the elements of an electrical circuit. An hydraulic approach 
 can be done to Kirchhoff´s law in order to carry out the analysis of the hydraulic network of a system, having to satisfied Kirchhoff´s 
 current law (KCL) and voltage law (KVL). Therefore, voltage and currents are replaced by pressure and flows, respectively. 

The critical points in a closed hydraulic system are usually the inlets and outlets of elements such as pipes, pumps and valves. 
The pressure drops taking place in the pipes and valves can be considered as inductors and nonlinear resistors, respectively. 

\textit{Maybe here before we start with the Graph Theory could be nice to make a figure showing the changes between the hydraulic circuit to the electrical 
one.}

The analogy between hydraulic and electrical circuits described above is applied in the graph theory…(start explaining Graph Theory).
