Water distribution networks are designed to deliver water to consumers in terms of sufficient pressure and appropriate chemical composition. Distribution systems as such are generally consist of four main components: pipes, pumps, valves and reservoirs. The common property is that they are all two-terminal components, therefore they can be characterized by the dynamic relationship between the pressure drop accross the two endpoints and the flow through the element\cite{Kallesoe2009}.  \eqref{ComponentState} shows the dual variables which describes one component. 

\begin{equation}
\label{ComponentState}
 \begin{bmatrix}
    \Delta P \\
    q
\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix}
    P_{in} - P_{out} \\
    q
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

In the following chapter the hydraulic model of the system is derived by control volume approach\cite{Hunt_Fluidmechanics}. The relationship between the two variables are introduced for each component in the hydraulic network.

\subsection{Pipe Model} 
\label{PipeModel}
Pipes are important components of water distribution systems since they are used for carrying pressurized and treated fresh water. A detailed model of pipes has to be derived in order to describe the relationship of pressure and flow for each pipe component.  
%
The dynamic model of a pipe can be originated from Newton's second law. \eqref{NewtonLaw} describes the proportionality between the rate of change of the momentum of the water and the force acting on it.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} M = \sum_i F_i
  \label{NewtonLaw}
\end{equation} 

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $M$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $F_i$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the linear momentum of the water flow\\
is the set of forces acting on the water.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{N}$
\end{minipage}

The dynamic model of a pipe component is derived under the assumption that the flow of the fluid is uniformly distributed along the cross sectional area of the pipe. In other words, all pipes in the system are filled up fully with water all the time. Thus the density of water and the volume of the fluid is constant in time, as is the mass of the water.
\\
Rewriting \eqref{NewtonLaw}, because of the above-mentioned asumptions, the mass of the water can be taken out in front of the derivative.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} M = {\frac{d(m v)}{dt}} = m \frac{dv}{dt} = \sum_i F_i
\end{equation} 

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $m$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $v$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}

is the value of the velocity of the water at each point of the pipe.

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m}{s}}$
\end{minipage}

The sum of the forces acting on the control volume can be seen as input forces, acting on the inlet of the pipe, output forces, acting on the outlet, resistance forces and gravitational force effect.  
These forces are expressed in terms of pressure in order to obtain the model of the pressure drop in the pipes. In \figref{fig:pipe_freebody} all forces acting on a pipe segment is shown:

\caption{Free-body diagram describing the forces acting on a segment of a pipe}
\label{fig:pipe_freebody}
\end{figure}

The pipe is assumed to have cylindrical structure. Furthermore, the cross section of the pipe, $A(x)$, is constant for every $x \in [0,L]$, where $L$ is the length of the pipe:

\begin{equation}
  A_{in} = A_{out} = \frac{1}{4}\pi D^{2}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $A$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $D$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the cross sectional area of a pipe\\
is the diameter of the pipe.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m^{2}}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m}$
\end{minipage}

Water flow($q$) can be expressed in terms of velocity($v$) and cross sectional 
area($A$), resulting in:
%Continuity law in fluid mechanics is applied to analyze the flow in the pipe\cite{Hunt_Fluidmechanics}. A steady and uniform mass flow is assumed in the pipe. Hence, the water flow can be described as: 

\begin{equation}
  q=A \cdot v
	\label{EquationOfContinuity}
\end{equation}

 In \eqref{LinearMomentum} the forces acting on the pipe are included, the difference between $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$ which indicates the pressure drop 
 between two endpoints, the resistance forces $F_{res}$ and the gravitational force effect due to change in elevation $F_{elev}$.

\begin{equation}
  m \frac{dv}{dt} = F_{in} - F_{out} - F_{res} - F_{elev} \\
  \label{LinearMomentum}
\end{equation}

In order to obtain an equation consisting of only pressure variables, the relationship between forces and pressures is used.


 \begin{equation}
    A L \rho \frac{dv}{dt} = A \textit{p}_{in} - A \textit{p}_{out} - F_{res} - F_{elev} \\
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}

\hspace*{8mm} $A$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $L$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\rho$\\

Rewriting the velocity in terms of volumetric water flow and cross sectional 
area. 

\begin{equation}
    A L \rho \frac{d}{dt} \frac{q}{A} = A \textit{p}_{in} - A \textit{p}_{out} - F_{res} - F_{elev}\\
\end{equation}

By dividing the equation with the cross sectional area, A, it can be seen that the equation is dependant on the pressure difference between two endpoints.
%Reducing the cross sectional area to obtain an expression for the pressure: 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =p_{in} - p_{out} - \frac{ F_{res}}{A} - \frac{ F_{elev}}{A} \\
\end{equation}

Thus the desired pressure drop between two endpoint is obtained. \eqref{PressureDrop} differential equation describes the change in flow as a function of the pressure drops in the system.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - \frac{ F_{res}}{A} - \frac{ F_{elev}}{A} \\
    \label{PressureDrop}
\end{equation}

In \eqref{PressureDrop} the term $F_{res}$ is the resistance force acting on the 
pipe, which consists of two parts: surface resistance($h_{f}$), the friction 
loss, and the form resistance($h_{m}$) due to the fittings. $F_{elev}$ is the force of gravity due to change of elevation, $\Delta z$.

\subsubsection{Surface Resistance (\texorpdfstring{$h_f$}{})} 
The flow of a liquid through a pipe suffers resistance from 
the turbulence occurring along the internal walls of the pipe, caused by the roughness of the surface. This surface resistance is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation \cite{Design_Water}.

\begin{equation}
  h_f = \frac{fLv^2}{2gD}
  \label{Darcy}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $f$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $h_f$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $g$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $D$ 
\end{minipage}

is the Moody friction factor\\ 
is the pressure given in head\\

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{m}{s^2}}$\\
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m}$
\end{minipage}

\eqref{Darcy} is under the assumption that $v>0$.%, therefore it is not dependant on $|v|v$ but on $v^2$. \\
Assuming that the flow is not unidirectional and substituting the velocity by the volumetric flow and pipe area:

\begin{equation}
  h_f = \frac{8fL}{\pi^{2}gD^5} |q| q
  \label{DarcyWeisbach}
\end{equation} 
 
 The unknown parameter in \refeq{DarcyWeisbach} is the Moody friction factor 
 which is non-dimensional and is a function of the Reynold´s number. This friction factor depends on whether the flow is laminar, transient or turbulent, and the roughness of the pipe\cite{Intro_Fluid}. \\
 
 
The Reynold´s number can be used to determine the regime of the flow\cite{Intro_Fluid}. When $Re<2300$ as laminar, if $2300<Re<4000$ as transient and if
$Re>4000$ as turbulent. 

\begin{equation}
   Re = \frac{vD}{\nu}
   \label{Reynolds}
 \end{equation}
 
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\nu$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the kinematic viscosity.

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{\frac{kg}{ms}}$
\end{minipage}

The kinematic viscosity in \cite{Design_Water} is given by :

\begin{equation}
  \nu = 1.792 \cdot 10^{-6} \bigg[1+{\bigg(\frac{T}{25}\bigg)}^{1.165} \bigg]^{-1}
\end{equation}

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $T$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the water temperature  
 \end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{^{\circ} C}$
\end{minipage}

In order to estimate the range of the Reynolds number of a common water 
distribution, typical values of the temperature, velocity and the radius of 
the pipes are considered\cite{Urban_Design}. 

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $v = 0.5 - 1.5  \quad \frac{m}{s}$
%   \item $D = 50 - 1500\quad mm$
%   \item $T = 10 - 20 \quad ^{\circ} C$
% \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $0.5 \leq v \leq 1.5  \quad \frac{m}{s}$
  \item $50 \leq D \leq 1500\quad mm$
  \item $10 \leq T \leq 20 \quad ^{\circ} C$
\end{itemize}


These values result in a Reynold's number between 19000 and 225000, which yields to consider a turbulent fluid flow through the pipes. For turbulent flow the 
Moody friction factor is given by \cite{Design_Water}: 

\begin{equation}
  f = 1.325 \bigg(ln\bigg(\frac{\epsilon}{3.7 D}+\frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}}\bigg)\bigg)^{-2}
  \label{turbulent}
\end{equation}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\epsilon$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the average roughness of the wall inside the pipe.
 \end{minipage}

\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{m}$
\end{minipage}

%
\subsubsection{Form Resistance (\texorpdfstring{$h_m$}{})} 
Form resistance losses appear at any time the flow changes direction, due to elbows, bends,
or due to enlargers and reducers. It is a particular frictional resistance due to the 
fittings of a pipe. Form loss can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  h_m = k_f \frac{v^2}{2g}
\end{equation}


Applying the definition of volumetric flow:

\begin{equation}
   h_m = k_f \frac{8}{\pi^2gD^4}  |q| q
\label{Formloss}
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $k_f$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is the form-loss coefficient.  
 \end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
\textcolor{White}{te}$\unit{-}$
\end{minipage}

The form-loss coefficient can be split into different loss depending on the 
fitting of the pipes: pipe bend and elbows. 
\\
Pipe bends principally is determined by the 
bend angle $\alpha$ and bend radius $r$, it is given by the following 
expression \cite{Design_Water}: 

\begin{equation}
  k_f = \bigg[0.0733 + 0.923 \bigg(\frac{D}{r}\bigg)^{3.5}\bigg]\alpha^{0.5}
\end{equation}

Pipe elbows are also used to change the direction of the flow but providing 
sharp turns in pipelines. The coefficient for the losses in elbows is determined by the angle of an elbow $\alpha$ and is given by:

\begin{equation}
  k_f = 0.442\alpha^{2.17}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Complete Pipe Model}
In \eqref{DarcyWeisbach} and \eqref{Formloss}, the head loss of the friction losses are determined. These terms are introduced in \eqref{PressureDrop} in terms of pressure. Thus, the friction factors are multiplied by the water density and gravity. Nevertheless, the head loss due to elevation has to be added in the model, yielding the final expression:

\begin{equation}
   \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - h_f \rho g - h_m \rho g - \Delta z \rho 
   g
\end{equation}

Substituting the terms $h_f$ and $h_m$ with their respective values:

\begin{equation}
\label{FinalPipeModel}
   \frac{L \rho}{A} \frac{dq}{dt} =\Delta p - \frac{8fL}{\pi^{2}gD^5} \rho g  |q| q - k_f \frac{8}{\pi^2gD^4} \rho g |q| q - \Delta z \rho g 
\end{equation}

\eqref{FinalPipeModel} describes the rate of flow in terms of pressure losses due to pressure change, frictions and elevation. A more compact form can be expressed for the $k$th component as such:

\begin{equation}
\label{FinalPipeModelCompact}
   J_k \dot{q_k} = \Delta p_k - \lambda_k(q_k) - \zeta_k 
\end{equation}

 \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
Where\\
\hspace*{8mm} $J_k$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\lambda_k(q_k)$ \\
\hspace*{8mm} $\zeta_k$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.68\textwidth}
\vspace*{2mm}
is an analogous parameter as inertia for the water\\ 
is the friction as a function of flow\\
is the pressure drop due to the elevation.
\end{minipage}

As can be seen in \eqref{FinalPipeModelCompact}, the flow dynamics of the $k$th pipe is described by $J_k$ which is an analogous parameter as inertia in mechanical systems. However, it is assumed(prior to the tests carried out on the system) that the presence of the water tower in the system has a slow effect on the flow due to slow integration behaviour. In other words it means that the water tower might have a relatively big time constant compared to the time constant of the pipe. Due to this consideration it would be a fair assumption that the parameter $J_k$ does not influence the flow significantly in the system, therefore it could be neglected. However, the parameter is kept until this assumption is not verified by tests. The complete model of a pipe yields: 
  
\begin{equation}
\label{FinalPipeModelSimplified}
  \Delta p_k  =   \lambda_k(q_k) + J_k \dot{q_k} + \zeta_k 
\end{equation}
