\section{Network Model}  
\label{SystemModel}

After deriving the dynamics of all components in the network, the complete system can be drawn. In \appref{systemdiagram}, the topology of the test system is described in detail. In the following, all the statements are based on the notation and relation system of the figure in the appendix. 
\\
The way of modelling the hydraulic system is analogous to an electric circuit. Most of the various hydraulic components can be represented as electronic equivalents and vice versa. 
\\
In the block diagram of the system nodes are introduced which  normally represent different potentials in an electronic system. In general, this is equivalent to hydraulic heads. Nodes represent points in the system where pressure has different values. These points are introduced arbitrarily while taking into account the fact that each individual component in the system has an effect on the pressure drop on their two corresponding endpoints. Therefore nodes are placed at all places where the modelling requires it. 
\\
In the network, volume flow rate is equivalent to current and the quantity of water has the same physical meaning as electric charge in an electric circuit. 
\\ 
Although nodes can be placed across all the endpoints of each component, some simplifications are present. There are two different types of simplification in the network. For a better transparency, these parts of the system are shown in \figref{fig:subsys_1} and \figref{fig:subsys_2}:

In \figref{fig:subsys_1} three components are shown between $n_3$ and $n_{18}$. This is the part where the WT connects in the system. In this particular case the pump is turned off, however contributes to the pressure drop due its resistance. The same can be said for the valves, except that they are fully open at all time but they modify the flow. Extra nodes are not introduced between the valves and the pump, instead they are seen as one component. This can be modelled by lumping the resistance of the valve, \eqref{CompleteValveModel}, into the model of the pipe, \eqref{PumpModel}, when the rotational speed is zero. Thus the following model yields for the case when $\omega = 0$:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta p = \Big(\frac{2}{k_{v100}^2} - a_{h2}\Big)|q| q 
  \label{omega_zero}
\end{equation}

And the following when $\omega \neq 0$

\begin{equation}
  \Delta p = \Big(\frac{2}{k_{v100}^2} - a_{h2}\Big)|q| q  + a_{h1} \omega_r q_i + a_{h0}{\omega_r}^2
  \label{omega_notzero}
\end{equation}

The case when $\omega = 0$ applies to components between $n_4$-$n_8$, $n_3$-$n_{18}$  and to $n_5$-$n_{13}$. The case when $\omega \neq 0$ applies to the two main pumps, between $n_1$-$n_2$ and $n_1$-$n_7$. All these subsystems are modelled as described above. 
\\
Since the components influence the pressure between the endpoints, as it was mentioned before, they can be represented as electric components. Valves are considered as nonlinear resistors, since the pressure is the quadratic function of the flow and it has a resistance depending on the OD. Pipes are modelled similarly as linear inductors with a nonlinear term. The pressure drop across their endpoints is the first derivative and quadratic function of the flow. The pumps provide pressure and therefore flow to the system. They can be seen as voltage generators. The WT is a simple capacitor, as it was described previously. The equivalence between the hydraulic and electric system is summarized in \tabref{tab:hydraulic_electrical}.
