This section will give an introduction to the available test system, including structure and components overview.  

\section{System overview}
To develop and test different control structures for a water distribution system a test setup is beneficial.
Such a setup is available at Aalborg university, this test setup is based on a real water distribution system, though as a 1:20 downscaled version.

The test setup represents a real systems, thus the same structure concerning piping, leveling and components are used. To achieve different elevations levels between systems parts the setup is mounted on a wall, this also allows for a quick overview of the complete setup and eases access to the components.
