\section{Results}



An operator clamps a finger by controlling the Geomagic Touch. As no equipment is available for measuring the force applied by the end-effector, the estimated force is compared with the position error and the current applied to the actuator. The experiment is made for the maximum frequency reached of 638 Hz in \figref{fig:fbkm}, which shows the operator slowly clamping the finger. For comparison, measurements for the original frequency of 100 Hz are displayed in \figref{fig:fbkm_100}, where the operator clamps and releases the finger at a fast pace.

Similarly to the experiment described for the gripping force, the operator uses the Geomagic Touch to control the roll and the movement of the end-effector are hindered by synthetic skin, the resulting measurements are represented in \figref{fig:fbkm_roll_100}.

\end{figure}

The pitch force model currently results in much higher estimates (around 10 N) on a real time system. The cause of this is not clear at the time of writing. As it is dependent on velocity, it is possible that velocities calculated from positions in the data sets, are differently scaled to the ones measured by the sbRIO.


The friction model derived in \secref{sec:friction} was applied to the data of \figref{fig:fbkm}, the obtained feedback is represented in \figref{fig:friction_validation}.

\section{Discussion}



From \figref{fig:fbkm}, the yaw force fed back to the user by the Geomagic Touch dynamically corresponds to both the current increase and the position error. From \secref{sec:friction}, the friction value computed for the gripping force are 0.20 and 0.21 A. This value is overcome at 2 s and the force fed back starts to increase at 2.2 seconds. Thus a delay of 0.2 seconds between applying force to the external environment and receiving feedback is present. Considering that the communication loops have a refresh rate of 638 Hz and 1000 Hz, amounting to a delay of 2.6 ms, the delay resulting from the communication can be neglected in front of the one resulting from the model. In addition, delay of 0.7 seconds is present when releasing the finger.
From \figref{fig:fbkm_100}, it can be seen that with a refresh rate of a 100 Hz the model can still estimate the dynamics of the force applied to the end-effector even when varying the command sent.

The roll model of a lower order can accurately track the dynamics of the force without showing the same delay, however it is more sensitive to noise as it can be seen at 6 seconds in \figref{fig:fbkm_roll_100}.


Unlike the yaw model, data acquisition for the pitch model was more difficult, as the EndoWrists structure affected measurements.
This results in additional nonlinearities in the measurements, since force was not always applied to an angle perpendicular to the load cell.
As a consequence, the model somewhat underestimates the applied force.

An attempt was made to implement state estimation the correct the force estimate.
The steady-state Kalman filter was implemented, with position error and velocity measurements used for state estimation.
Simulation results have shown that such a system would not improve the systems, as the current models do not capture the dynamics adequately.

In the future, an improved model could be utilized with state estimation to provide state feedback control of the outputed force.
The force reference could be directly mapped to the Geomagic Touch movement axes, providing a greater degree of control to the system.

In \figref{fig:fbkm}, the operator attempted to reach a point with no feedback outside of the main clamping. However it can be seen that before 2 seconds and after 11 seconds, that the operator moved trying to find that point and received feedback at that time. The first deduction is that the mapping and scaling of the command should not allow to attempt to open the clamp more that it is possible as the current increases when trying to exceed the range of movement possible. This conclusion was supported by the negative feedback visible in \figref{fig:fbkm_100}. The second deduction was that an accurate model of the nonlinearities was required. 
A model of friction was derived in \secref{sec:friction} and promising results were obtained in \figref{fig:friction_validation}. The oscillations are removed from the feedback when no strong current is applied. The negative force fed back from 12 to 14 seconds is due to the operator trying to open the clamp more than it is possible. It is believed that implementing this model would reduced the oscillations even further than it does in the simulation as the operator would have less difficulty in finding the point were there is no feedback.

+Although the refresh rate of the communication does not allow to reach the goal of 550 Hz for the feedback loop, a significant improvement can be noted.  To further increase the refresh rate, three methods are considered: compressing data, optimizing the programs and implementing on a real-time system.\\
 +Compression of exchanged data was evoked in \secref{subsec:minimizing}. It is believed that the implementation of a fast compression algorithm would improve the refresh rate in a communication between two computers. However additional precautions must be taken when implementing it on the embedded system, as the computation power is not as high as it is for a computer. The computation time required to compress the small amount of data sent should be compared to the transmission time of said data.\\
 +According to \cite{million_packets} it is possible to receive a million packets per second on a Linux system. Although such a high frequency cannot be reached when other tasks have to be performed on the computer. It should be possible to increase the frequency by optimizing the programs used for the project. Using low level libraries for communication would be the first step to improve the communication. In addition, the program currently runs many thread to communicate with external devices and between internal processes. These threads are not synchronized or prioritized, thus a new software architecture could reduce the load on the processing unit and ensure all threads can be properly executed.\\
 +The last method considered is an extension of the previous suggestion to create a new software architecture to increase control over the different thread. By using a real-time system, better control over the priority of each process can be achieved and thus less computation power can be allowed to processes non-essential for the force feedback, such as the graphical interface.\\
 +Another aspect that should be considered for future works is the safety in the communication. Currently only a simple detection of connection timeout has been implemented. In future application, security against cyber-attacks should be considered as the system could be extended to remote teleoperation.
