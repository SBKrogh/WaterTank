\section{TCP/IP}\label{sec:def_tcpip}

TCP/IP is a connection orientated protocol, which first establish the connection between two devices\cite{TCP_IP_UDP}. After the connection has been established data can be send in both directions. TCP/IP is a reliable protocol which ensure that the data transmitted, will be received. When the data is send, the transmitter waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver that the data has been received. If the data has been corrupted or the acknowledgment is not send, the transmitter will retransmit the package again. If the case of no acknowledgment is happening, a timer is used to define when to retransmit the data again. The data will then be retransmitted a certain amount of times until an acknowledgment has been received or the connection is defined to be disconnected. This means that a copy of the data is stored at the transmitter until it has been correctly received or the connection is taken down.\\
This communication protocol induces a delays in the system as the transmitter has to wait on the acknowledgment that the data has been received before loading new data into the sending buffer. If data has been discarded due to error the transmitter has to retransmit the data again if necessary.
