\section{User datagram protocol}
\gls{UDP} communication protocol is a faster way of communicating compared to TCP/IP\cite{TCP_IP_UDP}. It is connectionless which means that it wont establish a connection before sending data. When data is transmitted, new data is loaded into the transmitter buffer and then send when the connection line is free, thus the data is not stored at the transmitter as in TCP/IP. Furthermore the \gls{UDP} protocol does not wait for an acknowledgment and thereby just sends the data as fast as possible to the specified address.

% As the goal is to reduce latency in the communication between the robot and ROS it has been chosen to go with the \gls{UDP} protocol as it should be faster than the TCP/IP protocol, however less reliable. Because of the higher data rate, package loss or package error should not become a problem, as a new package is send as soon as possible. Furthermore instead of storing old data at the transmitter which can be obsolete if needed to be resend, as in TCP/IP, \gls{UDP} will send new data instead.
