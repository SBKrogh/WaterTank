\section{Friction model}

\label{sec:friction}
%In \secref{sec:estimation}, some small forces are fed back to the human leading to oscillations when no external forces are applied. It is suspected that accurately modeling the nonlinearities of the system would improve the transparency of the feedback.  
The current effort measured by the ESCON controller is proportional to the sum of the forces required to overcome the nonlinearities of the EndoWrist and the external forces applied to the end-effector.
 One of the main nonlinearities is the friction. For the system to be transparent, the force required to overcome friction should not be fed back as this force would not be felt if the teleoperator was holding the tool directly. In order to isolate the external forces, a friction model is required. The model built is based on the one derived in \cite{force_reflection} that describe the friction in a motor. However in the model it was decided to consider the motor and the EndoWrist as one element as no dynamic model for the motor alone is derived. Thus, the model estimates the sum of the friction in the EndoWrist and in the motor.

\subsection{Model}
The total friction acting on the actuator can be written as:
\vspace{9pt}
\begin{equation}
\tau_f = \tau_v + \tau_c + \tau_s
\label{eq:total_friction}
\end{equation} 

with:\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\tau_v$ viscous friction\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\tau_c$ coulomb friction\\
\hspace*{8mm} $\tau_s$ static friction    


The viscous friction is proportional to the opposite of the velocity:
\begin{equation}
\tau_v = F_\mu \cdot \omega
\label{eq:viscous_friction}
\end{equation}
with:\\
\hspace*{8mm}$\omega$ the angular velocity\\
\hspace*{8mm}$F_\mu$ a negative coefficient\\

The coefficient $F_\mu$ can be computed from the measurements made on the setup by plotting the effort depending on the velocity.

The stiction or static friction is the amount of effort required for the object to start moving when its velocity is zero. As such it can be described as:
\vspace{9pt}
\begin{equation} 
\tau_s =  \begin{cases} K_s, & \mbox{if } \omega = 0 \\ 0, & \mbox{else} \end{cases}
\label{eq:static_friction}
\end{equation}
with:\\
\hspace*{8mm}$\omega$ the angular velocity\\
\hspace*{8mm}$K_s$ a constant\\

%The constant $K_s$ can be measured by increasing the current supplied to the motor until it starts moving. 
The coulomb friction occurs as a constant force opposing the movement:

\begin{equation}
\tau_c = sign(\omega)\cdot K_c
\label{eq:coulomb_friction}
\end{equation}
with:\\
\hspace*{8mm}$\omega$ the angular velocity\\
\hspace*{8mm}$K_c$ a constant determined experimentally\\
\hspace*{8mm}the $sign$ function is defined as $sign(\omega) = \begin{cases} 1, & \mbox{if } \omega > 0 \\ 0, & \mbox{if } \omega == 0 \\ -1, & \mbox{if } \omega < 0\end{cases}$\\

%The constant $K_c$ can be measured by setting the motor in motion and decreasing the current until the motor stops moving.
From \eqref{eq:viscous_friction} to \eqref{eq:coulomb_friction}, the total friction given by \eqref{eq:total_friction} can be plotted as:

\subsection{Measurements}

For the model to be complete, each type of friction requries a value to be measured. These measurements need to be made for each joint as the nonlinearities in the EndoWrist varies greatly depending on the joints.

\subsection*{Test equipment:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Endowrist model 420093 (AAU number: \#4).
	\item Maxon 110160 motor with attached Maxon gearhead 110356 and Maxon encoder 201937.
	\item sbRIO board.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure:}
The viscous friction coefficient $F$ can be calculated by measuring the current for different speeds. From these values, an affine function can be computed, the slope of which will be the coefficient.
The constant $K_c$ for the Coulomb friction can be measured by setting the motor in motion and decreasing the current until it stops moving. The value of the current at that time is the value of $K_c$.
The constant $K_s$ for the static friction is measured by increasing the current sent to the motor until it starts moving. The value of the current at that time is the value of $K_s$.

This procedure is repeated for each motors.

\subsection*{Measuring data:}

    \hline
  \end{tabular}$
	\captionof{table}{Static friction coefficients}
	\label{fig:static_friction_coefficient}
\end{center}
\subsection*{Results:}

As it can be seen in \figref{fig:friction_measurement}, not only is the current measurement noisy but the position does not have a clearly distinguishable point where it starts increasing. This behavior of the position is due to the play between the motor and the EndoWrist and to the nonlinearities of the EndoWrist. Because of this it is impossible to obtain proper measurements of all coefficients with the equipement available for this project. As the goal for this project is not accuracy in the force feedback, it was decided to simplify the friction model.

In the new model, viscous friction is neglected as the end effector cannot move at high speed. In addition, the coulomb constant $K_c$ is chosen to be equal to $K_s$, by doing so the overall friction is slightly overestimated and the friction model removes the nonlinearities and insignificant external forces from the feedback. The values used for $K_s$ are gathered in \figref{fig:static_friction_coefficient}
\subsection*{Conclusion:}

The values for the static friction constants have been measured and used to build a new simplified model of friction that still suits the requirements this project. The new model is represented in \figref{fig:new_friction_model}. It is used in combination with the force estimation to increase the overall transparency.

\subsection{Applying the model to data}

The model derived was not applied to the input of the system but used to detect external forces. If external forces are applied to the end effector, the output of the force estimation is fed back, if not, no feedback is sent. The estimated force is fed back as long as the value of the current is sufficient to overcome friction.

% The model was applied to data recorded while an operator was attempting to start at a point where the feedback is zero, slowly clamp a finger and release it to return at the zero point
% %The model was applied to the data presented in \secref{sec:estimation}. 
% As it can be seen on \figref{fig:friction_validation}, the oscillations are removed from the feedback when no strong current is applied. The negative force fed back from 12 to 14 seconds is due to the operator trying to open the clamp more than it is possible.
